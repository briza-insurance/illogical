# illogical changelog

## 1.7.3

- Updating tsconfig and other dependencies.

## 1.7.2

- Resolving performance issues on simplify and removing unnecessary unsafeSimplify.

## 1.7.1

- Adding Reference cache and other performance improvements to condition parsing.

## 1.7.0

- Introducing unsafeSimplify which simplifies the condition without fully parsing it beforehand.
  Useful when processing complex conditions that have been previously parsed. Should be faster
  compared to the standard simplify when it can short circuit logical expressions.

## 1.6.1

- Bugfix on Arithmetic evaluate. Returns false when ContextValue is not present in the Context.

## 1.6.0

- Added support for Arithmetic expressions within other Comparison expressions. This allows for
  more complex and dynamic comparisons to be made. Now, you can perform mathematical operations
  within your conditional expressions, making them even more powerful and flexible. Whether you need
  to calculate sums, differences, products, or divisions, the new Arithmetic expression feature has
  got you covered. There are no breaking changes if this new kind of expression isn't being used.

## 1.5.9

- Modify OVERLAP expression such that the OVERLAP of two empty arrays returns true

## 1.5.8

- Introduce the backtick syntax for condition referencing keys that contain dot delimiters

## 1.5.7

- Update documentation to include example of comparison operator with two references
- Fix linting issues

## 1.5.6

- Comparison Expressions updated to support string comparison for ISO-8601 formatted dates.

## 1.5.5

- Expose default options for parser

## 1.5.2

- Update dependencies.

## 1.5.1

## 1.4.3

- Prevent unexpected parsing of any expression used as an operand in a comparison expression

## 1.4.2
